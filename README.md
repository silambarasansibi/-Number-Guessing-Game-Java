# -Number-Guessing-Game-Java
A Number Guessing Game is a simple Java project where the program randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly.
