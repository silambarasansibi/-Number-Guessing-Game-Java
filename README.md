# -Number-Guessing-Game-Java
A Number Guessing Game is a simple Java project where the program randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly.

Key Features:

The program generates a random number.
The player inputs guesses.
After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

How It Works:

Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using random.nextInt(100) + 1.
User Input: The user is prompted to guess the number, and their input is captured via scanner.nextInt().
Feedback: After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
Game Continuation: The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

Features to Add:

Range Customization: Let the user specify the range of numbers.
Guess Limit: Set a maximum number of guesses to make the game more challenging.
Play Again: Allow the player to restart the game after winning.

This is a great project to practice handling user input, loops, and conditionals in Java.
